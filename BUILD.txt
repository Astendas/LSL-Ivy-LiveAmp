To build the app CMake >= 3.5 is required.

Dependencies:
	Qt5 (free: https://www.qt.io/offline-installers)
	LSL (opensource: https://github.com/sccn/liblsl/releases/tag/1.13.1)


Locations of Qt5 and LSL are to be passed as command line arguments to the invokation of CMake. The generator must match the Qt5 distribution. For example:

>> cmake -S . -B build -DQt5_DIR=C:\Qt\5.15.0\msvc2019_64\lib\cmake\Qt5 -Dlsl_DIR=C:\Users\david.medine\LSL\share\LSL -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64

In practice the flags -DQt5_DIR and -Dlsl_DIR must point to the distribution's cmake files.

Packaging will be done automatically via github actions. To build from the command line:

>> cmake --build build --config release --target install
